## Summary 

The Polygon zkEVM is a Layer 2 scalability solution that uses zero-knowledge proofs to offer validity and quick finality to off-chain transaction computation. It executes smart contracts transparently and maintains opcode compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The zkEVM employs verifiable zero-knowledge proofs to prove the correctness of off-chain computations, and as a state machine, it carries out state changes and produces validity proofs. Its objective is to minimize user and developer friction while using the solution and recreate all EVM opcodes for the transparent deployment of existing Ethereum smart contracts. Detailed guides are available for Polygon zkEVM's architecture, design approach to state machines, running a local zkNode, participating in the zkEVM Testnet, and building on the Mainnet.

## Scaling Ethereum 

The Polygon zkEVM is designed to address the scalability issues of Ethereum, which cannot scale beyond its transaction threshold without sacrificing decentralization or security due to the DLT trilemma. The zkEVM emulates the Ethereum Virtual Machine by recreating all existing EVM opcodes for transparent deployment of existing Ethereum smart contracts. It uses Zero-knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups) to exponentially improve the scalability and transactions per second (TPS) of Ethereum while maintaining decentralization and security. To prove the correctness of off-chain computations, the zkEVM employs verifiable zero-knowledge proofs as validity proofs. As a state machine, zkEVM carries out state changes and produces validity proofs attesting to the correctness of the state change computations carried out off-chain. The objective is to minimize the user and developer friction while using the solution by recreating all EVM opcodes for the transparent deployment of existing Ethereum smart contracts. A new set of technologies and tools has been created and engineered by the team to achieve this.

## Architecture

Polygon zkEVM is a virtual machine designed to emulate the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and improve scalability and transactions per second (TPS) of Ethereum through Zero-knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups). Polygon zkEVM employs verifiable zero-knowledge proofs for off-chain computations to attest to their correctness. The major components of zkEVM include Consensus Contract, zkNode, Synchronizer, Sequencers & Aggregators, RPC, zkProver, and zkEVM Bridge. The consensus contract model employs a simpler technique, the Proof of Efficiency, and supports the permissionless participation of multiple coordinators to produce batches in Layer 2. zkEVM bridge allows users to transfer assets between two layers, and the Verifier contract is responsible for verifying the correctness of a proof ensuring a valid state transition. The network is designed to be permissionless, decentralized, secure, and efficient, with verifiable block data. Strategies such as deploying Consensus Contract, carrying out computations off-chain, using specialized cryptographic primitives, and utilizing zero-knowledge tools have been implemented for efficiency.
