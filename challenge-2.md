# 🪴 Challenge II: Deploy an ERC20 or ERC721 Token on the zkEVM Testnet


## Description: 
Deploy an ERC20 or ERC721 token on the [zkEVM Testnet](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop/). This challenge is easy and may take a few hours to complete. 

## Rewards:
Enter Lens allowlist, and claim a [**Lens**](https://www.lens.xyz/) handle.

## Get Started 🏃🏻‍♂️ 

- Setup your testnet environment for zkEVM development [here](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop#connecting-to-zkevm).

- Claim some tokens required to work with Polygon zkEVM testnet [here](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop#bridge-assets-to-zkevm) 

- Write a simple ERC20 or ERC721 token smart contract using Solidity, Or for more ease you can use [Openzeppelin wizard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard).

- Now lets compile and deploy your smart contract using solidity compilers like [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) on the Polygon zkEVM testnet, 

- For any doubts or references needed mid way deployment refer [zkEVM wiki](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop). 

- Once deployed head over to the [block explorer](https://explorer.internal.zkevm-test.net/) and lets verfy the deployment and get all the necessary information for the submissions.

- Things to look for submissions [ `Transaction hash` and `Contract address` ] 


## Challenge Submission and guidelines

- [ ] Fork the repository [ we hope you did that already 💫] 

- [ ] Create a new branch  `username_zkthon`, e.g.  `PriyathamVarma_zkThon`  [ we hope you already did this too  💫] 

- [ ] Now lets create a file named as `solution-2.md`.

- [ ] Now lets add the code for the smart contract deployed on Polygon zkEVM Testnet in `solutions-2.md`

- [ ] Create a Pull Request [PR] to the main repository

- [ ] Take the `Transaction Hash` and `Contract Address` and put it the Airtable form below with rest of the details.
