# ü™¥ Challenge II: Deploy an ERC20 or ERC721 Token on the zkEVM Testnet

> Challenge Description: your task is to deploy an ERC20 or ERC721 token on the zkEVM Testnet. This challenge is easy and may take a few hours to complete, and we can't wait for you to claim your **.lens** handle. 


## Steps on how to get started üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

- Let's start with setting up your development environment for zkEVM development by following the instructions [here](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop#connecting-to-zkevm).

- In order to get some test tokens for the Polygon zkEVM testnet, Watch the tutorial [here](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop#bridge-assets-to-zkevm) to get test tokens for the Polygon zkEVM testnet.

- Now lets write a simple ERC20 or ERC721 token smart contract using Solidity, Or for more ease you could get it from the [Openzeppelin wizard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard).
- Now lets compile and deploy your smart contract using solidity compilers like [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) on the Polygon zkEVM testnet, for any doubts and refrence needed mid way deployment refer [here](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop). 

- Once deployed head over to the [block explorer](https://explorer.internal.zkevm-test.net/) and lets verfy the deployment and get all the nesseary information for the submissions.
- Things to look for submissions [ `Transaction hash` and `Contract address` ] 

## Lets Proceed with the Submission and how do we proceed with that

- Fork the repository [ we hope you did that already üí´] 
- Create a new branch  `username_zkthon`, e.g.  `PriyathamVarma_zkThon`  [ we hope you already did this too  üí´] 
- Now lets create a file named as `solution-2.md`.
- Now lets add the code for the smart contract and the link to the deployed contract on the Polygon zkEVM testnet, with the `Transaction Hash` and `contract address` .
- Create a Pull Request [PR] to the main repository. 
- Once done, now lets post the submission and claim your lens handle, Add the information here [**Airtable form**](https://airtable.com/shr21z0FfPImZfYBQ) [ Things needed for submission ( Link to the `solution-2.md` file, `Polygon wallet address` ) ] **This is an Important step please don't skip on adding the detials here**
