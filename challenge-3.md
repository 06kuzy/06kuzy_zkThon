# üå≥ Challenge III: Fork a Major Protocol and Deploy it on the zkEVM Testnet 

> In this challenge, your task is to fork a major protocol and deploy it to the zkEVM Testnet. This challenge is intermediate and may take a few days to complete, and **claim an awesome T-shirt**. 

## Steps on how to get started üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

-  Let's start with setting up your development environment for zkEVM development by following the instructions  [here](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop#connecting-to-zkevm), Also here is an [awesome vedio from step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNBHDCGFxtw) to help you with setting up the local development and building a fullstack dApp with Polygon zkEVM, link to the repo [here](https://github.com/oceans404/fullstack-zkevm) for refrence. 
    
-   In order to get some test tokens for the Polygon zkEVM testnet, Watch the tutorial  [here](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop#bridge-assets-to-zkevm)  to get test tokens for the Polygon zkEVM testnet.

- Now lets find a smart contract deployed on the zkEVM Polygon network, You can use any contract deployed on the Polygon testnet. 

- Read the contract's documentation or ABI to understand its functions and inputs as how is the contract functioning. 

- After finished, create a simple script to interact with the contract in a programming language of your choosing. To interact with the contract more easily, use a framework like Web3.js or ethers.js.

- Use your script to run a function on the contract while giving any required arguments. For a reference example on how this may be done, you could utilise [**Steph's video**](https://youtu.be/GNBHDCGFxtw). You could also come and ask us questions in this [**Telegram group**](https://t.me/zkThon), and we'll attempt to assist you.

- Now just retrieve and display the output of the function call, and boom it's done.

## Challenge Submission and guidelines


- Fork the repository [ we hope you did that already üí´] 
- Create a new branch  `username_zkthon`, e.g.  `PriyathamVarma_zkThon`  [ we hope you already did this too  üí´] 
- Now lets create a file named as `solution-3.md`.
- Now lets add the smart contract and the code for your script in the file, with the `Transaction Hash` and `contract address` .
- Create a Pull Request [PR] to the main repository. 
- Once done, now lets post the submission and claim your lens handle, Add the information here [**Airtable form**](https://airtable.com/shr21z0FfPImZfYBQ) [ Things needed for submission ( Link to the `solution-3.md` file, `Polygon wallet address` ) ] **This is an Important step please don't skip on adding the detials here**
