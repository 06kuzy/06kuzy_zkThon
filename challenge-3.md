# üå≥ Challenge III: Fork a Major Protocol and Deploy it on the zkEVM Testnet 


## Description
Fork a major protocol and deploy it to the zkEVM Testnet. This challenge had intermediate difficulty and may take a few days to complete.

## Rewards
**Claim a Cool zkThon T-shirt**. [*Sharing the design with you all soon!*]

## Get Started üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- Setup your testnet environment for zkEVM development [here](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop#connecting-to-zkevm).

- Checkout this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNBHDCGFxtw) by Steph Orpilla, Devrel Engineer - Polygon Labs to help you with setting up the local development and building a fullstack dApp with Polygon zkEVM, link to the repo [here](https://github.com/oceans404/fullstack-zkevm) for reference. 
    
- Claim some tokens required to work with Polygon zkEVM testnet [here](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop#bridge-assets-to-zkevm) 

- Now lets find a protocol's smart contract deployed on Polygon PoS chain. You can get the contracts from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/)

- Read the contract's documentation or ABI to understand its functions and inputs as how is the contract functioning. 

- After finished, create a simple script to interact with the contract in a programming language of your choosing. To interact with the contract more easily, use a framework like Web3.js or ethers.js.

- Use your script to run a function on the contract while giving any required arguments. For a reference example on how this may be done, you could utilise [**Steph's video**](https://youtu.be/GNBHDCGFxtw). You could also come and ask us questions in this [**Telegram group**](https://t.me/zkThon), and we'll attempt to assist you.

- Now just retrieve and display the output of the function call, and boom it's done.

## Challenge Submission and guidelines

- [ ] Fork the repository [we hope you did that already üí´] 

- [ ] Create a new branch  `username_zkthon`, e.g.  `PriyathamVarma_zkThon`  [we hope you already did this tooüí´] 

- [ ] Now lets create a file named as `solution-3.md`.

- [ ] Now lets add the address of the smart contract deployed on Polygon zkEVM Testnet in `solutions-3.md`

- [ ] Create a Pull Request [PR] to the main repository

- [ ] Take the `Transaction Hash` and `Contract Address` and put it the Airtable form below with rest of the details.
