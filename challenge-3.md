# Challenge-3

> In this challenge, you will interact with a smart contract deployed on the Polygon network.

## Challenge Tasks

- Set up your development environment for zkEVM Polygon by following the instructions [here](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop#connecting-to-zkevm).
- Find a smart contract deployed on the zkEVM Polygon network. You can use a contract deployed on the Polygon testnet.
- Read the contract's documentation or ABI to understand its functions and inputs.
- Write a simple script in a programming language of your choice to interact with the contract. You can use a library like Web3.js or ethers.js to make interacting with the contract easier.
- Use your script to call a function on the contract, passing in any necessary inputs.
- Retrieve and display the output of the function call.

## Get Test Tokens for the Polygon zkEVM testnet

Watch the tutorial [here](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop#bridge-assets-to-zkevm) to get test tokens for the Polygon zkEVM testnet.

## Submission guidelines

- Create a new fork of the project and name it as <YOURNAME_ChallengeNO>
- Create a file named as solution-3.md
- Post the link to the smart contract and the code for your script in the file.
- Create a Pull Request to the main repository.
